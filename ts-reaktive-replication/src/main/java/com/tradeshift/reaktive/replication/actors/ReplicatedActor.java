/**
 * An extension to {@link AbstractStatefulPersistentActor} which allows persistent actors to work across data centers and legal regions.
 * 
 * Such an actor will only accept writes in one region, and forward emitted events to other regions where they should be present.
 * 
 * Implementations must define a public, no-arguments constructor that passes in the runtime Class types of C and E.
 * 
 * The first event emitted by the first command sent to this actor MUST store the local datacenter name, and
 * EventClassifier must return that datacenter name (as first element, if multiple) when given the event.
 * 
 * The persistenceId for a replicated actor MUST NOT be allowed to be client-picked, since the system must guarantee that
 * IDs generated on one data center aren't also created on others. This can be done by using GUIDs, or simply prefixing the 
 * data center name to the persistence ID.
 * 
 * If you have existing persistent actors with already-emitted events that you are "upgrading" to become replicated actors,
 * implement the {@link #createMigrationEvent()} method to have them "pin" themselves to the current datacenter. In addition,
 * you may want to run a persistence query to start/stop all existing persistenceIDs so that they all emit their
 * migration events.
